 `knock` is a simple, command-line network reachability tester. I made `knock`
 because I found myself using `telnet` to test if I could successfully connect
 to remote databases, webservers, and the like fairly often and realized that I
 don't actually need all of the features and historical baggage of that
 software: I just want to know if I can get from point A to B. `knock` is
 designed around this use-case. Other tools like `ncat` do more and better, but
 they also bring needless complexity to this task.

## Installation

Build from source or [download a pre-built binary].

```bash
$ ./build.tcl
```

## Usage

You can call `knock` just like `telnet`:

```bash
$ knock localhost 8080
Failed: connection refused.
```

Or with a colon:

```bash
$ knock 192.168.100.1:22
Succeeded.
```

Or with option flags:

```bash
$ knock -time 10 -dest example.com -port 8000 -net tcp
Failed: connection timed out after 10 seconds.
```

Normally, any problem connecting will be reported to the user
as explicitly as possible. Unlike `telnet`, `knock` will never
prompt the user for interactive input. As soon as a connection
succeeds, `knock` will hang up and report back that success.

### Options

| Option | Description                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| -dest  | Network destination address or name                     |
| -net   | Network type to use (default `tcp`)                     |
| -port  | Port number to `knock` on destination (default `80`)    |
| -time  | Time to wait in seconds before giving up (default `15`) |

### Networks
Supported network types are `tcp`, `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `udp`, `udp4`, `udp6`,
`ip`, `ip4`, `ip6 `, `unix`, `unixgram`, and `unixpacket`. The network types
with `4` in their name are IPv4-only, and those with `6` are IPv6-only.
